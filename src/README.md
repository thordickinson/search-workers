# Search Workers

## Prerequisites
* You will need JDK 8 or JDK 11

# How to run
Use the `search-workers` script in the directory root to run the project. As the project was developed on Windows,
you might need to give execution permissions first.

``chmod +x search-workers``

Then just need to run:

``./sarch-workers -h``

To see the help content. The first time it may take a bit while downloads all the 
required files and dependencies needed to build the project.
